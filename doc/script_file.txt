I. Description
$graphics_engine$ can read and execute plaintext files containing any script
commands detailed in "doc/interpreter.txt". Empty lines and lines beginning with
a "#" (comments) are ignored; the engine's parser will terminate with an
error message if an invalid command or argument is detected, and specify the
line number of the offending statement.
